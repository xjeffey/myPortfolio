                    <p>When students start their university journey, not only do they grow as a student, they grow as a person. Students also have wants and needs so they learn how to become financially responsible
                        to balance between schooling and personal expenses. However, receipts are easy to lose, making it hard for someone to keep track of their spending.</p>

                    <h1>ReceiptX received an A+ grade.</h1>
                    <p>My instructors gave us full freedom to choose our team members and come up with an idea for a capstone project. I was in charge of the
                        UX and Development strategies for the team. It was a pleasure to go through this journey with my team members that allowed me to
                        grow tremendously. Some of our key achievements listed below:
                    </p>
                        
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li><b>Turned an idea into a product.</b> The ability to turn a thought into something usable is a journey that is both exciting and rewarding. I worked with my team to shape
                        our end vision of ReceiptX. Although the product was just our capstone project, it was exciting to see how we grew as a team.</li>
                        <li><b>Applied sprints to demonstrate our progress.</b> My team and I applied the Scrum methodology to identify what we had accomplished and
                        what we need to do for each sprint.</li>
                        <li><b>Delivered the product on time.</b> Managing a team of people who do not know each other was not easy. I spent time to get to know the strengths
                        and weaknesses of each person, allowing me to assign them tasks based on their skillset. As a result, the team was able to work
                        together efficiently to complete the project on time.</li>
                        <li><b>Adapted to the pandemic.</b> During the development phase of the project, our team had to adjust how we operated because one of the members could not
                        work on the project anymore due to the pandemic.</li>

            <p>We decided to focus on college students, specifically anyone above first year students (undergraduate) as they transition between living in a dorm to an apartment where rooming feedbacks

                <h1>Defining the MVP</h1>
                <p id="extra-para">My team and I went through workshops and sketching sessions to map out the user flow of our application.
                    In addition, we did usability testing with this paper prototype to influence the high fidelity version.
                </p>

                <p>We identified the following key features:</p>

                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Google authentication.</b> Users connect their Google account to link their application data.</li>
                    <li><b>Manual and image receipt data entry.</b> Receipt data can be entered into our application by taking an image or entering in required information.</li>
                    <li><b>Review data of a receipt.</b> Display information of receipt to user.</li>
                    <li><b>Goal setting.</b> Allow users to set monthly spending goals to work towards being financially responsible.</li>
                    <li><b>Filtering/sorting receipt data</b> Users can select what receipts they want to see on the screen.</li>
                    <li><b>Graphs of monthly spending</b> View monthly expenses, allowing users to track expenses and indicate spending habits.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Implementation</h1>
                <p>I was the scrum master and Android developer during the development phase of the project. I held bi-weekly meetings to let my team
                    members update me on what they did, what they are doing, and what they will do. After our discussion, I assigned tasks that needed
                    to be completed for the next sprint. Outside of this role, I worked with another team member to develop and look for resources to 
                    implement into our application.

            <h1>Results and Takeaways</h1>
            <p id="extra-para">Working on ReceiptX was quite an eye-opening experience as it allowed me to put the skills I had developed during 
                my undergraduate journey to the test. The project also taught me a lot abut knowing where to focus my energy and efforts.
            </p>

            <p>Some key take aways from this project are that:</p>
            
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><b>Have a plan.</b> These projects take time and effort. Having a plan helps a team estimate where they should be in the project.</li>
                <li><b>Plans can alter.</b> Although having a plan is important for any project, they can change accordingly. It is important to be able to adapt to change.</li>
                <li><b>Communication is key.</b> Better ideas come with discussion. Talking with teammates also help each other be on the same page during a project.</li>
                <li><b>Understand the roles of each team member.</b> No role is too important in a project. Learning about what each team member does allows for better conversations because you can talk in terms they can understand.</li>
