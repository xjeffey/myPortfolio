					<h1>CREATING SOLUTIONS WITH EMPATHY</h1>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="column">
							<h3>Where I&rsquo;ve been</h3>
							<p>When I first came to Indiana University, I was planning on pursuing Computer Science, but did not have a reason why. I guess I liked coding because I enjoy problem solving. As I progressed on the Computer Science journey, I felt something missing as I completed my work. Working with other people is something I did all throughout middle and high school as I participated in extracurricular activities such as football and track. Although I did collaborate with others during Computer Science projects, there was minimal face to face interaction. In Spring 2018, I discovered UX Design from taking a course called Human Computer Interaction Design with Marty Siegel. From his course, I learned the basics of what is wanted in UX Design by following the pRInCIPles of design, Research, Insights, Concepts, Iterate, and Prototyping.</p>

							<h3>What I&rsquo;m doing</h3>
							<p>While I was learning about UX Design, I realized that I would have to work on my interpersonal skills because designers work directly with client to see exactly what he or she wants for a product. This year I was able to be an Undergraduate Instructor for 50 students that in Discrete Mathematics. This experience allowed me to find solutions with different kinds of people. Each student understood the concepts from class in their own way and I was able to explore their knowledge while holding office hours. It was a pleasure to work with a few students on a weekly basis because our conversations did not only cover topics in class but also included advice on what to do in the future. By working with these students, I believe that I am able to clearly communicate with others to see what the goal is and how I plan on reaching it.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h3>What I hope to do</h3>
							<p>After this school year, I plan on finding an internship or full-time job that will allow me to get my feet in the UX Design field. After doing projects in school, I believe I have developed a solid foundation that has prepared me to get real-world experience. During my time in doing UX work, whether it be in the education, medical, business, or any other industry, I hope to make a difference in a person&rsquo;s life with my design concepts. After working for a few years, I also plan on getting into graduate school to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree in Human Computer Interaction Design to further enhance my skills. There is so much to learn because people have all kinds of problems that have many solutions to them. Being able to adapt to clients will allow me to be a better UX Designer.</p>
