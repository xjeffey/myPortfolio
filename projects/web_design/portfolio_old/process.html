				<h1>pRInCIPles of Design</h1>

				<!-- received image from https://pixabay.com/ -->
				<img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="Empathy">

				<p>Everytime I work on a UX Design project, each one goes through a similar journey. There are 5 different phases that I go through when I am following the pRInCIPles of Design. The first phase to conduct research, second phase is to get some insight, third phase is to generate concepts, fourth phase is to iterate the process by testing, and the last phase is to create a prototype. These phases will allow me to work with clients and get to understand what it is that they want. Empathy plays a huge roll when I work on UX Design projects. I have to understand the feelings of the user to see what is troubling them. Great designs come from this emotion!</p>

			<div class="process">
				<div class="research">
					<h3 class="circle">Research</h3>
					<p>I rely on my research skills to gain an understanding on what is wanted for a design and who it is intended for. To do this, I primary and secondary research methods that I have learned from school. For primary research, I use methods such as Interviews, Questionnaires, and Observations. Interviewing people is a good way to learn more about what the issue is and the right questions have to be prepared so the conversation can go well! To do secondary research, I go online and read articles on about a situation.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="process-icon"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb fa-5x"></i></div>

				<div class="insight">
					<p>After talking to the potential users, I take the notes I took and try to get a better understanding of what the potential users want in a design. I learned methods such as Personas, Focus Groups, and Mind Mapping that help me gain insight. Personas are a great way for me to think about what a user wants in the design. When I am stuck on an idea, I ask myself, what does Person X like? Finding a Focus Group is another way for me to see what users think about the ideas that I generate. Having these conversations can also lead to a better idea!</p>
					<h3 class="circle">Insight</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="process-icon"><i class="fas fa-chalkboard fa-5x"></i></div>

				<div class="concept">
					<h3 class="circle">Concept</h3>
					<p>When I find an idea that I want to stick with, I start generating different concepts for it. I learned methods such as Brainstorming, Card Sorting, Sketching, and Storyboards that help me portray my ideas. Brainstorming is a way for me to get anything I am thinking out of my head, whether it be good or bad ones. I pick one of the concepts that I came up with and begin making different sketches out of it so I can visualize the design. After I make some sketches, storyboard allow me to see how users will use the design and re-do the process if necessary!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="process-icon"><i class="fas fa-redo-alt fa-5x"></i></div>

				<div class="iterate">
					<p>To see how well the design is thought out, I conduct Usability Testing with about 4 to 6 potential users with a set of tasks to follow. Before I conduct the testing, I create a Paper Prototype so that users can have something to interact with during the conversation. Paper Prototyping is a method that allowed me to create my concept quickly. People tend to disregard the look of it because it was made by a human. If the digital version wasn&rsquo;t designed properly, users would critique the design more than the usability. During the testing, I ask the volunteers to think aloud so I can understand what is going through their mind when using the prototype. If the design turns out not to be user-friendly, I go back in previous steps and see where it can improve on. Sometimes I may have to go back to the beginning!</p>
					<h3 class="circle">Iterate</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="process-icon"><i class="fas fa-robot fa-5x"></i></div>

				<div class="prototype">
					<h3 class="circle">Prototype</h3>
					<p>When users are satisfied with the usability of my concept, I begin to create a digital version with Adobe XD or ask someone for help. I go back and conduct more usability testing to see if the potential users like to design. If anything goes wrong during the testing, I go back to the previous phases again. Otherwise, the design would go on to be developed even further so that the users can have a user-friendly product!</p>
